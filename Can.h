 * CanSat 2020-2021 Team Autonomeasure - Can
 * Code written by: Joep van Dijk
 * First mission:
 *    Our first mission is to be able to land properly, collect data from the BMP280 sensor and send that data to the groundstation at least one time per second. 
 * 
 * Second mission:
 *    Our second mission is to make a sustainable data collection station.

 * ERROR CODES:
 *  0: No error occured
 *  1: BMP280 module failed to initialize
 *  2: MPU6050 module failed to initialize
 *  
 *  10: Invalid BMP280 data
 *  11: Invalid MPU6050 data
 *  
 *  30: The GPS time is invalid
 *  31: The GPS location is invalid
 *  32: The GPS altitude is invalid
 * 
 * TODO
 * 		1) Figure out what should be done if an error occurs
 * 			1) Just ignore it?
 * 			2) Try to fix it by recalling Can::tick / rereading the sensor / etc
 * 		2) Write the Can::tick logic
 * 		3) Write the Can::checkRadioConfiguration check so it checks if the radio is configured correctly
 *    4) finish Can::calculate_expected_time_until_impact
 *
